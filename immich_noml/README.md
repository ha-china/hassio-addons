## About

Self-hosted photo and video backup solution directly from your mobile phone. This is the NoML (No Machine Learning) variant of Immich designed for systems without machine learning capabilities or users who prefer to disable ML features for performance or resource management reasons.

This addon is based on the [docker image](https://github.com/imagegenius/docker-immich) from imagegenius with machine learning components excluded to reduce resource consumption and improve compatibility with resource-constrained systems.

## Use Cases

The NoML variant is ideal for:

- **Resource-constrained systems**: Lower CPU and memory usage without ML overhead
- **Privacy-focused deployments**: No facial recognition or object detection processing
- **Simple photo storage**: Basic photo and video backup without advanced AI features
- **Legacy hardware**: Systems that struggle with machine learning workloads
- **Minimalist setups**: Users who prefer basic photo management without AI enhancements

## Configuration

Webui can be found at `<your-ip>:8080`. PostgreSQL can be either internal or external.

```

### Mounting Drives

This addon supports mounting both local drives and remote SMB shares:

- **Local drives**: See [Mounting Local Drives in Addons](https://github.com/alexbelgium/hassio-addons/wiki/Mounting-Local-Drives-in-Addons)
- **Remote shares**: See [Mounting Remote Shares in Addons](https://github.com/alexbelgium/hassio-addons/wiki/Mounting-remote-shares-in-Addons)

### Custom Scripts and Environment Variables

This addon supports custom scripts and environment variables through the `addon_config` mapping:

- **Custom scripts**: See [Running Custom Scripts in Addons](https://github.com/alexbelgium/hassio-addons/wiki/Running-custom-scripts-in-Addons)
- **Environment variables**: See [Add Environment Variables to your Addon](https://github.com/alexbelgium/hassio-addons/wiki/Add-Environment-variables-to-your-Addon)

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

**Steps:**
1. [Add my Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
1. Install this add-on.
1. Click the `Save` button to store your configuration.
1. Start the add-on.
1. Check the logs of the add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Carefully configure the add-on to your preferences, see the official documentation for for that.

**Database Setup:**
Beware that you need to install a separate postgres addon to be able to connect the database. You can install the postgres addon already in my repository.
Beware to change the password BEFORE starting it ; it won't change afterwards
